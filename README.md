Welcome to my software engineering portfolio! This repository contains details about my projects, skills, and background as a software engineer.

## About Me

As a seasoned Software Engineer armed with a Master's degree in Computer Science, my journey has been 
fueled by a relentless pursuit of excellence. Graduating from the prestigious SWE bootcamp, App Academy, where only 
3% gain acceptance, laid the foundation for my expertise.
<br>
<br>
My career path is a blend of different strengths: technical skills, good communication, problem-solving knack, 
and a strong commitment to getting things done. Challenges motivate me to grow and innovate. In the world of 
software engineering, I look forward to tackling new obstacles, finding smart solutions, and continuously pushing 
my limits.
<br>
<br>
I am actively seeking a company where I can contribute my diverse skill set and thrive as a software developer. 
I aspire to channel my expertise, problem-solving finesse, and relentless drive into making substantial contributions 
while continuously evolving and improving within a dynamic software development environment.
